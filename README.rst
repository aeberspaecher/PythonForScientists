Python Programming for Scientists
=================================

About
=====

This is the source for a talk the author (Alexander Ebersp√§cher) has
given at the informal student's seminar at the X. informal Billiard
Workshop of the German Research Unit 760 at Riezlern, Kleinwalsertal.

It was meant to be both a very short introduction to the Python
programming  as well as a short demonstration of advanced topics
such as scientific packages (NumPy, SciPy). Python as a glue
language was targeted, too.

Slides
======

If you are only interested in the pdf slides:

Dependencies
============

You'll need Pygments for the syntax highlighted LaTeX snippets to work.

Notes
=====

In the directory ``Pygsnippets`` you'll find the code snippets that
appear on the slides, too.

The folder ``Code`` contains the code I have used for the
benchmarks. The Cython ad f2py files contain some hints on the
creation of shared objects.

In comparison to presentation I gave in Riezlern, there are two new
slides. Minor bugs have been fixed. Let me know if you find more.
